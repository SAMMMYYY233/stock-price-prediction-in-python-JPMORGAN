# stock-price-prediction-in-python-JPMORGAN
some development to add a chart to a trader’s dashboard allowing them to better identify under/over-valued stocks.  The trader would like to be able to monitor two historically correlated stocks and be able to visualize when the correlation between the two weakens (i.e. one stock moves proportionally more than the historical correlation would imply). This could indicate a potential trade strategy to simultaneously buy the relatively underperforming stock and sell the relatively outperforming stock. Assuming the two prices subsequently converge, the trade should be profitable.  Most data visualization for our traders is built on JPMorgan Chase's Perspective data visualization software, which is now open source. If you want to explore that, a link is provided in the resources section.   Before implementing this request using perspective, first you’ll need to interface with the relevant financial data feed and make the necessary adjustments to facilitate the monitoring of potential trade opportunities.  * Understanding the finance and trading part is not required.  * Being familiar with python scripting language and command line basics is not required as you will be guided in this exercise
